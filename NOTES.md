1. Redmiles, Elissa M. et al. ["How I Learned to be Secure: a Census-Representative Survey of Security Advice Sources and Behavior."](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~eredmiles/camera_ready_ccs2016.pdf) Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (2016): n. pag.
-   Users with higher skills who tend to be socioeconomically advantaged take advice from workplace and have skills necessary to learn from a negative experience.
-   Users with lower skills who tend to be socioeconomically disadvantaged take advice from family, friends, and service providers, increasing their vulnerability. They also self-report fewer security practices.
-   Users reject inconvenient advice, but also advice with too much marketing.
-   Advice should be simple, less intrusive, and have negative experience stories.
-   For password and physical security users evaluatee on their own; they feel confident.
-   For updating, antivirus, and 2FA, users rely on evaluation of trustworthiness of advice source.
-   In this paper they used the top-four suggestions from 2. below.
-   53% of users use stronger passwords for some accounts
-   84% of users use antivirus.
-   Majority patch software, but "immediately" isn't defined in this paper. 40% don't think patching software is related to security.
-   Minority use 2FA. 64% had never seen information nor had been prompted to use this security strategy.
-   Majority are informed by media and advertising; paper suggests improving advertising.
-   "Future work could examine how to effectively simulate negative experiences, for example by using short, relatable stories that clearly demonstrate how to prevent the problem".

-   Experts most frequently report installing software updates, using 2FA, and using a password manager to stay safe online.
-   Non-experts report using antivirus software, visiting only known websites, and changing passwords frequently.
-   Passwords
    -   Unique
    -   Strong
    -   Use a password manager
-   Antivirus
-   Updating software
-   Mindfulness
    -   Visiting only known websites
        -   Only non-experts think this is effective. "Google's transparency report on safe browsing shows that most malwre websites are not malicious attack sites, but compromised sites that are used to spread malware".
    -   Checking for HTTPS indicators
    -   Email habits,
    -   Not ignoring SSL warnings
    -   Phishing, man-in-the-middle, malware
    -   Be suspicious of links
    -   Don't enter passwords on lins in email
    -   Don't open email attachments from unknown
-   Experts point out antivirus isn't bullet proof, only for easy viruses, must be kept up to date
-   Experts don't emphasize changing passwords frequently
-   Password managers are stilil complicated for non-technical users
