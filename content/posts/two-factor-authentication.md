-   In 2018, Google reported than less than 10% of users use 2FA
-   In 2016, Dropbox reported less than 1% of users use 2FA.
-   "those who have never used 2FA are likely to perceive it as more difficult to use than it actually is"
-   Users afraid of losing phone and not being able to log in again
-   If account not perceived as high-security then users don't think it is worth it.
-   Recommendations of researchers
    -   Deploy 2FA incrementally, only start with systems where security benefits outweigh costs
    -   Provide clear instructions on how to use, and simple steps for avoiding lockout and what to do if locked out
    -   Convince users that 2FA is valuable and easy to use.

-   "However, about one-third of the participants reported an instance of not having their second-factor
    device immediately available when they needed it."
-   Two thirds of participants using TOTP had a problem typing it in before timeout
-   25% of participants felt like backup codes are just another password, did not understand
