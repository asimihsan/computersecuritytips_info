We do so much online now, and increasingly it's no longer an option to opt-out
of being online. Despairingly, every day reveals yet another data breach,
passwords being stolen, and people being duped.

In this blog, "Computer Security Tips", I will educate you on security measures
you can take to keep your online data and accounts safe. These measures are
specific and easy to follow. Howver, they can still be hard to make a habit of.
Being secure online is not a matter of installing the right product, or paying a
lot for products. Staying safe and secure comes down to attitudes and habits.
This is just like brushing your teeth twice a day, where you believe it is
important and then build up a habit of doing so.

My name is Asim and I've been working for Amazon for around five years, of which
I've spent two years at Amazon Web Services (AWS). I help other software
engineers make secure systems on behalf of our customers. Please let me help you
stay safe online!

Research shows that user's attitude towards online security threats correlate
with their adherence to good security practices [^1] [^2]. Hence I will strive
to not just teach you the theory and practices, but also give you clear reasons
why these practices make a difference.

This blog is intended for non-software-engineers who are interested in keeping
their online data and accounts safe but don't have time for long-winded
explanations or expensive software pitches.
