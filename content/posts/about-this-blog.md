We do so much online now, and increasingly it's no longer an option to opt-out
of being online. Despairingly, every day reveals yet another data breach,
passwords being stolen, and people being duped.

In this blog, "Computer Security Tips," I will educate you on how you can keep
your online data and accounts safe. These measures are specific and easy to
follow. However, they can still be hard to make a habit of. Being secure online
is not a matter of installing the right product or paying a lot for products.
Staying safe and secure comes down to attitudes and habits. This is just like
brushing your teeth twice a day, where you believe it is essential and then
build up a habit of doing so.

Research shows that users' attitude towards online security threats correlate
with their adherence to proper security practices [^1] [^2]. Hence I will strive
to teach you the theory and practices and also give you clear reasons why these
practices make a difference.

This blog is intended for non-computer-experts interested in keeping
their online data and accounts safe but don't have time for long-winded
explanations or expensive software pitches. You don't need to be a software
engineer to benefit from this blog and stay safe online.

in the software industry for twelve years. I’ve designed and worked on software
systems that process sensitive data such as financial data for digital products
and videos of people in Amazon Go. I also help other software engineers make
secure systems on behalf of our customers. I'm passionate about computer
security and computing in general.

The views on this blog are my own and do not reflect my employer's views.
